  Hello, my name is Solveig Greene. I am a 1st-grade teacher in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I have been teaching elementary school for 14 years. In 2007, I graduated from LSU in elementary education. In 2014, I gained my masterâ€™s degree in Educational Leadership. I am working on my specialist degree. I am attending the University of Missouri. I do not have experience with web development. My instructor and classmates will provide me with knowledge in this area. My plans for the future are not clear yet. I am unsure of what my plans are for the future. I hope to make more money in the future. I am a believer in being a lifetime learner. I hope to use what I learn as fuel to keep my learning growing. I have two young boys ages 4 and 7. They keep me busy. Spending time with my family and traveling makes me happy.
