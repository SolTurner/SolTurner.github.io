        <p>
        I am an elementary teacher. 
        <br>I have been teaching for 14 years. One of the greatest parts about being a teacher is recognizing the importance of being a lifelong learner. 
        <br>I truly believe that we should all be constantly investing in our own learning throughout our lives. 
        <br>Expanding our knowledge and mindsets allow us to become the best that we can become. 
        <br>During my career, I have invested myself into many learning opportunities to expand my knowledge. 
        <br>Throughout this website, I hope you are able to identify that learning is my passion and that I have the ability to learn anything that I put my mind to. 
        <br>I hope you enjoy looking around my website to learn more about me. 
        <br>Please be sure to check out my video and resume below. 
        <br>Happy Learning!</p>
