        <h1>Learn More</h1>
    <p><div><p>In 2007, I graduated from Louisiana State University in elementary education. I began teaching at the age of 23 and now 
        I have been a teacher for 14 years. I have remained at the same school during my career. I currently teach first grade, but I have taught 
        grades 1, 2, and 3. I have served as grade level chair for ten years. Throughout my career, I have gained a range of expertise especially 
        with teaching students that come from poverty. I have learned a lot about helping children develop the habits required to become lifelong 
        inquirers. Many of my students come to school without their basic needs met. I always begin the year focusing on building trust with my 
        students. Trust between a teacher and student is critical for student growth. I am a strong believer in positive classroom management. 
        Praise is a key component to keeping motivation levels high with students. Many students come from homes full of stress, so it is essential 
        to create a learning environment that fosters a sense of community, happiness, and growth mindsets. My students come to me with a wide range 
        of ability levels. Differentiating learning is a critical component of my instruction. Differentiation is crucial in a class of diverse learners. 
        Success with students occur when I make decisions based on their needs. Throughout my career, I have had many opportunities to enhance my knowledge
         through Professional Developments as well as gaining my masterâ€™s degree. In 2014, I graduated with my masters from Southeastern University in 
         Educational Leadership. This learning opportunity increased my knowledge of educational leadership theories through my studies. Throughout my 
         internship, I completed 120 hours of educational leadership practice by working alongside of my administrator. During my career, I also completed 
         the training in the International Bacculerate Primary Years Program model. I spent a lot of time observing one of the top IB schools in Europe 
         throughout a ten-year span. This opportunity allowed me to observe a school quite opposite of mine but also gave me many ideas and practices to 
         bring back to my own classroom. Also, I attended the training in Cultures of Thinking. The training is part of Harvard's Project Zero. </p>
