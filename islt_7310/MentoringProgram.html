        <h1>Mentoring Program</h1>
    <p><div><p> 
        Mentoring Program: Throughout my teaching career, I mentored many students from the LSU college of education. 
        In my earlier years, I mentored LSU students that were completing their ELA and Social Studies blocks in elementary 
        education. Over the last six years, I mentored LSU Holmes students who were completing their masterâ€™s degrees in elementary 
        education. I mentored each for an entire school year. In the spring of 2020, the Louisiana State Department decided that all 
        mentor teachers must complete a mentoring program and take an assessment to prove they have the competencies to be a mentor. 
        Although, I have not completed the program yet, my anticipated completion date is May of 2021. This program requires me to 
        complete a self- paced learning course on mentoring new teachers through APEL. Once the modules are completed, a four-part 
        assessment through BloomBoard is required for certification. The assessment process through BloomBoard is very time consuming 
        and requires artifacts to be submitted by myself and my mentee for approval of passing. The program focuses on Mentoring for 
        content instruction, mentoring for classroom management, building knowledge through content-rich text-sets, and adapting high-quality 
        material to meet student needs. For each section, I had to analyze the needs of my mentee and students, develop a systematic plan, 
        implement the plan and collect many artifacts to prove the plan was working, and evaluate the progress of my mentee and students. 
        My mentee and I worked together to identify areas of growth that we felt would help her improve her in all of the areas listed above. 
        The artifacts I have included on this page are just a few of the artifacts that I feel represent the work that has gone into completing 
        the assessments to be a certified mentor. This experience has forced me to look deeply into my own teaching, coaching, and leadership 
        skills and analyze them for improvement. Throughout the process, I kept a growth mindset, therefore, I have strengthened my habits in each area.
