    <h2> Reflections on Career</h2>


    <p>My personal teaching philosophy has always been to create a learning culture that helps students  
       develop understanding and respect of one another so that all participants learn from one another, gain a 
       growth mindset, and to develop habits of a life-long learner. Throughout my career thus far, I have 
       taken every advantage I have been given to grow and learn. The professional developments, learning 
       opportunities, and degree advances have helped me model what I want my students to achieve as they get older. </p>
    <p>As I began teaching at age 23, I never imagined that I would have stayed at one school in Baton Rouge, 
        Louisiana throughout my career. I always dreamed of traveling the world and teaching at International schools 
        during my career. One major reason for this is that I traveled a lot when I was little with my family. My father 
        was an educator that traveled the world. I was born in India, moved to Japan, Brazil, Florida, Massachusetts, 
        Tennessee, and finally landed in Louisiana. While I stayed in Louisiana for college, my family moved onto Amsterdam 
        and now are located in the Philippians. When I traveled the world, I was exposed to many cultures that triggered my 
        thought process. I have a gained a great appreciation and understanding of many cultures. There is something so 
        exhilarating to me about learning how different cultures approach aspects of life that are different than my own. 
        As my life did not allow me to follow through with my dream, I have found ways to stimulate my mind and grow my 
        mindset right from my hometown. </p>
    <p>The school I have chosen to teach at throughout my career, busses in students from an area in the city that is known 
        for being a low social economic status. Every student that has walked through my classroom doors has taught me how 
        to be a better person. The struggles that I have witnessed my students go through over the years have taught me that 
        I did not struggle as a child and the need for educators to help students cope with the struggles they are experiencing. 
        As I got older in my career, I realized that I could not save every child that walks through my door. However, I can 
        provide a place that my students feel supported, loved, understood, and invested in. As mentioned earlier, this is why 
        I spend so much time developing trust with my students. The trust that I develop with my students is the reason I am able 
        to help them make great gains in their academic growth. </p>
    <p> The programs I took part of during the 2020-2021 school year include the mentor program, leadership program, and grad school 
         courses towards my specialist degree. They have all shown me the ability I have to juggle many components at once. As a wife 
         and mother, I have had to adjust my lifestyle to be able to achieve my personal career goals. I have proven to myself that no 
         matter what the workload is, I can handle the work and I can be successful. Although, I am not exactly sure of what direction 
         all my investment in my learning will take me next, I have stayed true to my personal philosophy of being a lifetime learner. 
         I now have a wide variety of experience with technology and design, leadership, and mentoring. I hope to apply all that I have 
         learned towards my next career and continue to grow as an individual through investing in my personal growth of learning.
