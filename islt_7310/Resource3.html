        <h1>Leadership Program</h1>
    <p><div><p> At the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year, I was accepted by the East Baton Rouge Parish 
        school board to be part of the 2020-2021 Instructional Leader for Tomorrow Cohort IX. Although, I have 
        not completed the program yet, my anticipated completion date is June 2021. The goal of the program is 
        to develop a pool of qualified candidates to fill the need for new exceptional school leaders in the district.
        The program is set up like a college course through Canvas. There is a text aligned with the content of the 
        program. I attend live classes 1-3 times a month (depending on the month and content) and submit work for 
        feedback. I am also assigned to an administrator that is not my current administrator as my mentor. I stay 
        in communication with my mentor throughout the process and shadow her in action for 35 hours throughout the 
        school year. The overall focus of the program is to train and support the candidates in the following areas: 
        data driven instruction, observation and feedback, instructional planning, professional development, 
        student culture, staff culture and managing school leadership teams. I am also working with
        my cohort to learn about EBR budgeting with both Title I and the General Funds, master scheduling, 
        the role of the school counselor at all school levels, parental and community involvement, using the 
        Teacher Evaluation rubric, writing a school improvement plan, mock interviews, and certification in 
        non-violent crisis involvement. The compass leader rubric established by the Louisiana department of 
        education is used to determine the readiness of the participants to lead. My involvement with the 
        program has given me great insight into what is required of the leaders in my district. Meeting many 
        of the important leaders in the district and attending the classes they have provided throughout the 
        program has allowed me to gain knowledge from their expertise.
