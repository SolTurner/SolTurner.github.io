            <p><h1>Specialist Degree Program</h1>    
                In the spring of 2020, I was accepted to the Learning Technologies 
                and Design Educational Specialist degree program by the University 
                of Missouri. My anticipated graduation date is Spring of 2022. The 
                program requires 30 graduate credit hours. The program is designed 
                to train students in the following areas: design learning environments; 
                develop learning systems apps; understand usability; user experience; 
                new technology and communication; improve workplace performance; learn 
                best practices for needs assessment; task analysis, and course design 
                and development. I have included more information on the degree page.</p> 
            <p><h1>Leadership Program</h1>
                At the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year, I was accepted by the East 
                Baton Rouge Parish school board to be part of the 2020-2021 Instructional 
                Leader for Tomorrow Cohort IX. The program is for inspiring leaders. 
                Although, I have not completed the program yet, my anticipated completion 
                date is June 2021. I have included more details on the leadership page. 
            </p>
            <p><h1>Mentor Program</h1>
                Throughout my teaching career, I mentored many students from the LSU 
                college of education. In my earlier years, I mentored LSU students that were 
                completing their ELA and Social Studies blocks in elementary education. Over the 
                last six years, I mentored LSU Holmes students who were completing their masterâ€™s 
                degrees in elementary education. I mentored each for an entire school year. Mentoring 
                is something that I throughly enjoy. My relationships with my mentees are ones that 
                always continue on for years after. There is something amazing that happens to a classroom 
                when there are two teachers. Helping teachers grow throughout the year is an amazing feeling. 
                I really enjoy helping my mentees find their growth mindset since that is something educators 
                all must have to continue fostering professional growth.<br>
