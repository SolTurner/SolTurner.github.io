                In the spring of 2020, I was accepted to the Learning Technologies 
                and Design Educational Specialist degree program by the University 
                of Missouri. My anticipated graduation date is Spring of 2022. The 
                program requires 30 graduate credit hours. The program is designed 
                to train students in the following areas: design learning environments; 
                develop learning systems apps; understand usability; user experience; 
                new technology and communication; improve workplace performance; learn 
                best practices for needs assessment; task analysis, and course design 
                and development. I chose this degree so that I could increase my knowledge of 
                technology as it plays such a vital role in education. I hope to 
                gain knowledge of the competencies so that I can broaden my 
                expertise in education. The program has already taught me so 
                many skills that I would not have even known how to begin 
                learning on my own. Even the instruction in my classroom has 
                improved as I have learned how to effectively analyze the needs 
                of my students and implement best practices to improve student 
                outcomes. I have widened my knowledge of technology platforms 
                and how to use technology in the classroom to improve instruction.The 
                overarching goals of the program are listed below. I have also 
                included some artifacts that demonstrate my ability to meet the 
                goals of the program.

            <h1 id=leadership>Leadership Program</h1>
            At the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year, I was accepted by the East 
            Baton Rouge Parish school board to be part of the 2020-2021 Instructional 
            Leader for Tomorrow Cohort IX. The program is for inspiring leaders. 
            Although, I have not completed the program yet, my anticipated completion 
            date is June 2021. I have included more details on the leadership page. 
            The goal of the East Baton Rouge Leadership program is to 
            develop a pool of qualified candidates to fill the need for 
            new exceptional school leaders in the district. The program 
            is set up like a college course through Canvas. There is a 
            text aligned with the content of the program.  I attend live 
            classes 1-3 times a month and submit work on each topic for 
            feedback. I am also assigned to an administrator that is not 
            my current administrator as my mentor. I stay in communication 
            with my mentor throughout the process and shadow her in action 
            for 35 hours throughout the school year. The overall focus of 
            the program is to train and support the candidates in the 
            following areas: data driven instruction, observation and 
            feedback, instructional planning, professional development, 
            student culture, staff culture and managing school leadership 
            teams. I am also working with my cohort to learn about EBR 
            budgeting with both Title I and the General Funds, master 
            scheduling, the role of the school counselor at all school 
            levels, parental and community involvement, using the Teacher 
            Evaluation rubric, writing a school improvement plan, mock 
            interviews, and certification in non-violent crisis involvement.  
            The compass leader rubric established by the Louisiana department 
            of education is used to determine the readiness of the participants 
            to lead. My involvement with the program has given me great insight 
            into what is required of the leaders in my district. Meeting many of 
            the important leaders in the district and attending the classes they 
            have provided throughout the program has allowed me to gain knowledge 
            from their expertise. One of the requirements of the program included 
            completing the COMPASS Training for Evaulators. I have included my 
            certificaton for proof of completion. I have also included a piece of 
            my writing that explains what I think exceptional leadership is.

            <h1 id="mentor">Mentor Program</h1>   
                     <br>In the spring of 2020, the Louisiana State Department decided 
                     that all mentor teachers must complete a mentoring program and take an assessment to prove they 
                     have the competencies to be a mentor. Although, I have not completed the program yet, my 
                     anticipated completion date is May of 2021. This program requires me to complete a self- paced 
                     learning course on mentoring new teachers through APEL. Once the modules are completed, 
                     a four-part assessment through BloomBoard is required for certification. The assessment 
                     process through BloomBoard is very time consuming and requires artifacts to be submitted 
                     by myself and my mentee for approval of passing. The program focuses on Mentoring for content 
                     instruction, mentoring for classroom management, building knowledge through content-rich text-sets, 
                     and adapting high-quality material to meet student needs. For each section, I had to analyze the needs 
                     of my mentee and students, develop a systematic plan, implement the plan and collect many artifacts to 
                     prove the plan was working, and evaluate the progress of my mentee and students. My mentee and I worked 
                     together to identify areas of growth that we felt would help her improve her in all of the areas listed 
                     above. The artifacts I have included on this page are just a few of the artifacts that I feel represent 
                     the work that has gone into completing the assessments to be a certified mentor. This experience has forced 
                     me to look deeply into my own teaching, coaching, and leadership skills and analyze them for improvement. 
                     Throughout the process, I kept a growth mindset, therefore, I have strengthened my habits in each area.
                     Below you can find a copy of the Coaching Plan I created for my mentee for the 2020-2021 school year.
