         <div class="col"><p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education (Grades 1-8) from LSU and a 
             Master's degree in Educational Leadership from Southeastern University. I currently attend the 
             University of Missouri to gain my specialist degree in Learning Technologies and Design 
             (expected graduation date is Spring 2022). For the past fourteen years I have taught in the 
             challenging but dynamic environment of Highland Elementary School located in East Baton Rouge 
             Parish in Louisiana. I have taught grades one, two and three and have served as grade level leader. 
             During the past thirteen years, I have successfully mentored field experience students through 
             LSU’s College of Education. Over the last five years, I have successfully mentored Holmes students 
             from the College of Education. Over the course of my career, I have learned much about helping children 
             develop the habits required to become lifelong inquirers. I have had the good fortune to have completed 
             training in the IB PYP model up through Level 2. I have also been able to visit a leading PYP school in 
             Europe on several occasions and have completed a powerful workshop on Cultures of Thinking with Ron Ritchhart 
             of Harvard's Project Zero. I was also selected to attend a symposium in Princeton for Women in Leadership. 
             I am currently enrolled in APEL’s mentor teacher program and plan on being certified by the summer of 2021. 
             This year, I was also accepted into the East Baton Rouge Parish Leadership program. My completion date is 
             June of 2021.</p><br>
