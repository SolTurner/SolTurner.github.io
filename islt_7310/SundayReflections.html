            <div><p>My personal teaching philosophy has always been to create a learning culture that helps 
                students develop understanding and respect of one another so that all participants learn from one 
                another, gain a growth mindset, and to develop habits of a life-long learner. Throughout my career 
                thus far, I have taken every advantage I have been given to grow and learn. The professional developments, 
                learning opportunities, and degree advances have helped me model what I want my students to achieve as 
                they get older.<br>
                <p>The school I have chosen to teach at throughout my career, busses in students from an area in the city 
                    that is known for a low social economic status. Every student that has walked through my classroom doors 
                    has taught me how to be a better person. The struggles that I have witnessed my students go through over 
                    the years have taught me that I did not struggle as a child and the need for educators to help students 
                    cope with the struggles they are experiencing. As I got older in my career, I realized that I could not 
                    save every child that walks through my door. However, I can provide a place that my students feel supported, 
                    loved, understood, and invested in. As mentioned earlier, this is why I spend so much time developing trust 
                    with my students. The trust that I develop with my students is the reason I am able to help them make great 
                    gains in their academic growth.<br>
               </p>The programs I took part of during the 2020-2021 school year include the mentor program, leadership program, 
              and grad school courses towards my specialist degree. They have all shown me the ability I have to juggle many 
              components at once. As a wife and mother, I have had to adjust my lifestyle to be able to achieve my personal career 
              goals. I have proven to myself that no matter what the workload is, I can handle the work and I can be successful. 
              Although, I am not exactly sure of what direction all my investment in my learning will take me next, I have stayed 
              true to my personal philosophy of being a lifetime learner. I now have a wide variety of experience with technology 
              and design, leadership, and mentoring. I hope to apply all that I have learned towards my next career and continue 
              to grow as an individual through investing in my personal growth of learning.<br>
