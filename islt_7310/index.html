    <h1> Welcome to my website!</h1>       
    <p> 
    <br>My name is Solveig Greene and my goal for this website is to provide you with information about my career as a teacher and programs that I am currently enrolled in that I am hoping will further my career.
    When going through my website you will visit an about me page that will include a short overview of my accomplishments, my resume, a photo of myself, and a link to a short video.
    Then, you can visit my page about the programs that I am in and completion dates. I also have a page that discusses my reflections on my career and a page that includes my contact information.
    My hope is that you will gain information about me as an employee and recognize my commitment to my employer, my students and my personal growth.
    </p>
